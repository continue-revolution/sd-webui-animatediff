# AnimateDiff for Stable Diffusion WebUI

> I have recently added a non-commercial [license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) to this extension. If you want to use this extension for commercial purpose, please contact me via email.

> It seems that WebUI v1.9.0 has some major mess-up. Please do not use this WebUI version. You can use either v1.8.0 or v1.9.3 (latest).

This extension aim for integrating [AnimateDiff](https://github.com/guoyww/AnimateDiff/) with [CLI](https://github.com/s9roll7/animatediff-cli-prompt-travel) into [AUTOMATIC1111 Stable Diffusion WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) with [ControlNet](https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet), and form the most easy-to-use AI video toolkit. You can generate GIFs in exactly the same way as generating images after enabling this extension.

This extension implements AnimateDiff in a different way. It inserts motion modules into UNet at runtime, so that you do not need to reload your model weights if you don't want to.

You might also be interested in another extension I created: [Segment Anything for Stable Diffusion WebUI](https://github.com/continue-revolution/sd-webui-segment-anything), which could be quite useful for inpainting.

[Forge](https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge) users should either checkout branch [forge/master](https://github.com/continue-revolution/sd-webui-animatediff/tree/forge/master) in this repository or use [sd-forge-animatediff](https://github.com/continue-revolution/sd-forge-animatediff). They will be in sync.

## Update
- [v2.0.0-a](https://github.com/continue-revolution/sd-webui-animatediff/tree/v2.0.0-a) in `03/02/2023`: The whole extension has been reworked to make it easier to maintain.
  - Prerequisite: WebUI >= 1.8.0 & ControlNet >=1.1.441 & PyTorch >= 2.0.0
  - New feature:
      - ControlNet inpaint / IP-Adapter prompt travel / SparseCtrl / ControlNet keyframe, see [ControlNet V2V](docs/features.md#controlnet-v2v)
      - FreeInit, see [FreeInit](docs/features.md#FreeInit)
  - Minor: mm filter based on sd version (click refresh button if you switch between SD1.5 and SDXL) / display extension version in infotext
  - Breaking change: You must use Motion LoRA, Hotshot-XL, AnimateDiff V3 Motion Adapter from my [huggingface repo](https://huggingface.co/conrevo/AnimateDiff-A1111/tree/main).

## Future Plan
Although [OpenAI Sora](https://openai.com/sora) is far better at following complex text prompts and generating complex scenes, we believe that OpenAI will NOT open source Sora or any other other products they released recently. My current plan is to continue developing this extension until when an open-sourced video model is released, with strong ability to generate complex scenes, easy customization and good ecosystem like SD1.5.

We will try our best to bring interesting researches into both WebUI and Forge as long as we can. Not all researches will be implemented. You are welcome to submit a feature request if you find an interesting one. We are also open to learn from other equivalent software.

That said, due to the notorious difficulty in maintaining [sd-webui-controlnet](https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet), we do NOT plan to implement ANY new research into WebUI if it touches "reference control", such as [Magic Animate](https://github.com/magic-research/magic-animate). Such features will be Forge only. Also, some advanced features in [ControlNet Forge Intergrated](https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge/tree/main/extensions-builtin/sd_forge_controlnet), such as ControlNet per-frame mask, will also be Forge only. I really hope that I could have bandwidth to rework sd-webui-controlnet, but it requires a huge amount of time.


## Model Zoo
I am maintaining a [huggingface repo](https://huggingface.co/conrevo/AnimateDiff-A1111/tree/main) to provide all official models in fp16 & safetensors format. You are highly recommended to use my link. You MUST use my link to download Motion LoRA, Hotshot-XL, AnimateDiff V3 Motion Adapter. You may still use the old links if you want, for all other models

## Tutorial 
There are a lot of wonderful video tutorials on YouTube and bilibili, and you should check those out for now. For the time being, there are a series of updates on the way and I don't want to work on my own before I am satisfied. An official tutorial should come when I am satisfied with the available features.
